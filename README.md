### As of 01-16-2025 this is no longer maintained

For a while I really haven't had much interest maintaining since I personally don't use a lot of graphical applications. Plus, I primarily use window managers, so fixing Gnome or KDE related issues isn't something I'd know how to do.

All I really did was just use `oomox` to update the theme, and hope it fixes an issue.

This theme should continue to work (Unsure about GTK-4, but QT6 applications work fine with [qt6gtk2](https://github.com/trialuser02/qt6gtk2)) for the time being.
